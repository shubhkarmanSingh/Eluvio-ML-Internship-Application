## Eluvio_Data_Visualization
### Here I set out to do some basic preprocessing on the news titles and create a mapping of the top frequencies of particular phrases/words and then create a visualization and graph.

## Eluvio_Kmeans
### The problem that I set out to tackle was to cluster the new titles using kmeans and see if I can produce different categories of news topics that were popular during this time period

## Eluvio_models
### Using the results I got from my Kmeans clustering, I ran various models (naive bayes, logistic regression, and neural network) to see if I can classify the news titles into the clusters from the Kmeans algorithm.
